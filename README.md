# vaop-in-examples-20221101
This program is calculating a sum of positive elements of array in case of array contains array and so on.
Perhaps it is biggest program in Python to solve such simple task. I wrote this program as an example of using V-agent oriented programming (VAOP) metology.
In this example I am also first time introducing my innovation of  "three dot notation" in name of VAOP-engine variables
It is easy to see that when you change the va-script and add new actions, you can solve problems of unlimited complexity.
